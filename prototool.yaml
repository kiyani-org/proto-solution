#       # Optional file suffix for plugins that output a single file as opposed
#       # to writing a set of files to a directory. This is only valid in two
#       # known cases:
#       # - For the java plugin, set this to "jar" to produce jars
#       #   https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/java-generated#invocation
#       # - For the descriptor_set plugin, this is required as using descriptor_set
#       #   requires a file to be given instead of a directory.
#       file_suffix: jar

#       # descriptor_set is special, and uses the --descriptor_set_out flag on protoc.
#       # file_suffix is required, and the options include_imports and include_source_info
#       # can be optionally set to add the flags --include_imports and --include_source-info.
#       # The include_imports and include_source_info options are not valid for any
#       # other plugin name.
